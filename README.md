# MRI Segmentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an MRI brain segmentation algorithm framework, capable of processing both 2D and 3D images. This project aims to provide a reliable segmentation solution, especially beneficial in scenarios where data for learning-based approaches is scarce.

## Features

- Implements both 2D and 3D segmentation algorithms.
- Modular design for easy experimentation and enhancement.
- Includes various refinement techniques like Edge-based Refinement and Convex Hull Refinement.
- Performance evaluation through metrics such as Jaccard index, Dice, and AUPRC.
