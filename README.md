# MRI Segmentation: A Classical Approach

### TODOs

- [ ] Review ways to test the algorithm
- [ ] Try to improve a little bit the algorithm
- [ ] Make a table with the changes sometimes.
    - Some improvements must be subject to specific things
    - Try to keep an understanding of the problem with data (not only visually)
    - Perform a diagram of the proposed method and it's close best variant
- [ ] Start to write and propose the 3D segmentation
- [ ] Check how the methods work hahahaha =P
